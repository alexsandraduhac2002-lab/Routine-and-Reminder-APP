# Routine and Reminder App

## Objective
This app is designed to help people, especially those with ADHD or unorganized routines, build structure in their daily lives. It allows users to create customizable schedules, receive automatic reminders, and track their progress. The app also includes social features such as shared routines and followers for motivation and accountability.

## Key Features
- **Custom schedules**: Create routines with daily, weekly, monthly, or one-time repeats.
- **Flexible editing**: Routines can be updated, changed, or deleted anytime.
- **Reminders**: Automatic notifications, even offline, with multiple alert options.
- **Progress tracking**: Stats and streaks to show consistency and improvement.
- **Private/Public schedules**: Users choose which routines to keep personal or share with others.
- **Followers system**: Follow others and get inspired by their public routines.
- **Shared schedules**: Collaborate with family, classmates, or teams. Everyone in the group receives the same reminders.
- **Categories and color coding**: Organize schedules by type for clarity (Work, School, Health, Personal).
- **Missed task log**: Displays routines that were skipped to help users reflect and improve.
- **Motivational boosters**: Custom notes, sounds, or encouraging reminders to make the app more engaging.
- **Social feed**: Browse public routines for ideas and inspiration.

## Target Users
- People with ADHD or attention difficulties
- Unorganized individuals who want to improve
- Students balancing schoolwork and personal time
- Young professionals or freelancers managing flexible schedules
- Families or roommates who want shared routines

## Why This App Stands Out
Unlike regular calendar or reminder apps, this app combines simple routine scheduling with motivational tracking and optional social features. It is designed to be user-friendly, visually engaging, and supportive, especially for people who struggle with maintaining structure in their daily lives.

## Next Steps
1. Create UI/UX prototypes in Figma.
2. Finalize user flows and interface design.
3. Decide on the technology stack (for example: Flutter for mobile app, Firebase for backend).
4. Begin development with a focus on core features (scheduling, notifications, and stats).
5. Add advanced features such as sharing, followers, and social feed.
