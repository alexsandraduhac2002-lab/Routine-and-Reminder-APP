# Routine and Reminder App (Prototype Stage)

## Description
This repository is for documenting and prototyping an idea for a **Routine and Reminder App**.  
The app is not yet in development. The goal is to take note of the concept, define objectives, and create a prototype before moving into coding.  

The app is designed to help people, especially those with ADHD or unorganized routines, build structure in their daily lives. It combines customizable schedules, automatic reminders, and progress tracking with motivational and social features such as shared routines and followers.

## Objectives
- Provide an easy-to-use tool for creating and managing routines.  
- Support people who struggle with time management, focus, or consistency (e.g., ADHD users, students, freelancers).  
- Encourage consistency through progress tracking and motivational reminders.  
- Offer flexibility with private, public, and shared schedules.  
- Build a community aspect where users can follow and be inspired by othersâ€™ routines.  
- Prototype and refine the design before writing any code.

## Planned Features

### Core
- **Custom schedules**: Create routines with daily, weekly, monthly, or one-time repeats.  
- **Flexible editing**: Update, change, or delete routines anytime.  
- **Reminders**: Automatic notifications with multiple alert options.  
- **Offline notifications**: Works even without internet connection.  
- **User stats**: Progress tracking, streaks, and completion rates.  

### Social and Sharing
- **Private/Public schedules**: Control visibility for each routine.  
- **Followers system**: Follow others and get inspired by their routines.  
- **Shared schedules**: Collaborate with family, classmates, or teams.  
- **Social feed**: Browse public schedules for ideas and motivation.  

### Organization and Motivation
- **Categories and color coding**: Organize schedules by type (Work, School, Health, etc.).  
- **Missed task log**: See which routines were skipped.  
- **Motivational boosters**: Add personal notes, encouraging reminders, or custom sounds.

- Students balancing schoolwork and personal time.  
- Freelancers and professionals with flexible schedules.  
- Families or roommates who want shared routines.  
- Anyone who feels unorganized but wants to improve their daily habits.

## Current Stage
- Idea conceptualization  
- Documentation of objectives and features  
- Creating design prototypes in Figma (UI/UX first)  
- Preparing for future development (possible stack: Flutter + Firebase + Node.js)  

---

## Next Steps
1. Complete Figma prototypes for main user flows.  
2. Gather feedback on usability and feature set.  
3. Finalize design direction (UI/UX theme, colors, navigation).  
4. Plan minimum viable product (MVP) for first version.  
5. Move toward coding stage when ready.
